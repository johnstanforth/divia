Dev Notes
=========


- Manually installed Python 3.6 on Ubuntu 17.04 (via 'apt install python3.6') but causes many problems

- Not sure which of these worked now, but saving for future reference:
  sudo apt install python3-pip
  sudo apt install python3-venv
  sudo apt install python3-dev
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
